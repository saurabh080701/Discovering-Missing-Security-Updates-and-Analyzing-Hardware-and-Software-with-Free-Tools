## Using-MBSA-Software-list-all-the-security-updates-missing-in-Window-OS

Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer is one of the tools provided by Microsoft to help administrators to scan systems (local and remote) for missing security updates and common security misconfigurations. It can scan the server operating system and SQL Server but also other products as well, such as Microsoft web server IIS.

Here is what Microsoft says on its download page for the latest version of the tool at the moment this article is written:

*To easily assess the security state of Windows machines, Microsoft offers the free Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) scan tool. MBSA includes a graphical and command line interface that can perform local or remote scans of Microsoft Windows systems.*

*MBSA 2.3 will scan for missing security updates, rollups and service packs using Microsoft Update technologies. To assess missing security updates, MBSA will only scan for missing security updates, update rollups and service packs available from Microsoft Update. MBSA will not scan or report missing non-security updates, tools or drivers.*

### More information  

For security compliance and for desktop/server hardening, we recommend the Microsoft Security Baselines and the Security Compliance Toolkit.
